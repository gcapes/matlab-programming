Recap:
------
Number types, and automatic, silent type casting
Scripts (automating the command prompt), functions, flow control.
Efficiency:
	vectorisation
	column-wise ordering
	use built-in functions
	pre-allocate arrays
	pointer to Cambridge efficiency pages

How-to:
--------
Load data from a directory of text files using a loop
Process data in the workspace:
	extract sub-sets of data
	basic statistics
	remove bad data points (spikes, drop-outs, implausible values)
Save plots to disk
Import screenshot of a graph from a paper, then plot your data on top
Modify trace appearance using handles or right click on trace in figure
	file/generate code to get script for existing figure
Average data onto new time base for comparision
Debugging demo:
	break points
	evaluate small sections at a time
	version control revert

Tips and common problems:
------------------------
Load data window remains open after loading data (looks like nothing has happened if maximised)
Close MATLAB - no prompt to save workspace variables; only modified scripts


Good practice:
