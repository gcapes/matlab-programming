MATLAB course review plan:

Basic idea:
	Have intro course as online module
	Split into modules for easy access
	Based heavily on Jonathan's intro course
	Exercises for assessment, which gives access to MATLABPRO course
	MATLABPRO course to be based on software carpentry and Jonathan's course
	List ideas to be covered, then decide how to meet the objectives
	
The problem:
	I've got overwhelmed.
	I wanted to change the course material to include more examples. It was very slides/exercises, where I thought some worked examples would be more helpful.
	Software carpentry lesson was too advanced for beginners, but maybe not advanced enough for intermediate.
	I've compounded the problem by teaching it to the intro course.
	I've thought about keeping Jonathan's intro course, but having it as online only - supplemented with screenshots and a few other modifications. 
	However, most of the material is already in the MATLAB help files - MATLAB/ getting started/ tutorials (for example).
	There are also other online lecture notes from e.g. MIT. What's the point reinventing the wheel? http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-094-introduction-to-matlab-january-iap-2010/lecture-notes/
	So, what to do? A few options:
		Teach Jonathan's material with minor modifications
		Teach Software Carpentry with some modifications
		Signpost to MIT course 
		Signpost to MATLAB built-in tutorials + selected examples (there's loads)
		Have intro course online only
		Have both courses online (works for the Fortran courses!)
