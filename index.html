## 1. Recap

---

## MATLAB GUI
- Command window
	- Type commands for immediate execution
	- Variables created persist in workspace after commands finish
- Workspace
	- Contains variables stored in memory
- Editor
	- Write commands for execution later on
	- Save files with `.m` extension and run using the name of the file e.g.
```
>> myscript % runs the file called myscript.m
```

---

## Number types

- Computers represent numbers using [binary numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number),
  most frequently using floating point numbers
- Floating point numbers are an approximation to real numbers, and
  not all numbers can be represented exactly (c.f. 1/3 in decimal)
- [What every scientist should know about floating point arithmetic
  ](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html)
- Default data type in MATLAB is double (i.e. double precision:
  approx 16 significant decimal digits)
- Be aware of the maximum and minimum values that can be stored by a given
  number type
  ```
  intmax('uint16')   % max value for an unsigned 16-bit integer
  realmin('single')  % minimum value for single precision floating point
  eps                % floating point relative accuracy
  ```
- MATLAB performs automatic type casting (without warning)
```
intmax('uint8')    % max value that uint8 can store = 2^8 -1
a = uint8(300)     % a = 255 (300 truncated to max value)
b = 2.3 + 1e6 + a  % b = 255 (b is uint8)
```

---

## Variables

- Used to store values
- Created implicitly
```
a = 23   % Assign value 23 to a variable, a.
             % If 'a' doesn't already exist it will be created.
             % If 'a' already exists, it will be overwritten.
class(a) % Returns class of variable 'a'.
```
- Numeric variables are of `class` double by default
	- must explicitly create other numeric types if required
- MATLAB doesn't prevent you from using built-in MATLAB keywords
	- Can 'overwrite' MATLAB function names very easily
```
intmax('uint8')          % Returns max value of 8-bit integer
intmax = intmax('uint8') % Create variable 'intmax'
% This blocks access to the 'intmax' function
intmax('uint8')          % Now returns an error
```
- Names must start with a letter
- Chose descriptive names which don't mask built-in functions
- Demo

---

## Scripts and functions

- **Scripts** are like automating the command window
	- Have access to variables in the workspace
	- Variables persist after script execution
- **Functions** have their own scope
	- Cannot directly access variables in the workspace or other functions
	- Can only use variables from the workspace if passed in as arguments
	- Variables created in a function do not persist after execution
	(unless returned as output arguments)
- Run a script or function using the **name of the file** in the command window
(or another script/function)
- To avoid confusion, ensure the filename matches the function name
- A `.m` file can only be run if it is on the MATLAB `path` (list of directories to search)
- Both scripts and functions are very helpful in terms of reproducibility
- Demo

## 2. Worked examples
### (Writing scripts and functions)

---

## Import CO<sub>2</sub> data from text files

(Data from NOAA: [CO2], [temperature], [metadata for temperature][metadata])
- Load the CO<sub>2</sub> [data file] (data/co2_weekly_mlo.txt), using the **Import Data** tool to select:
	- column delimiters
	- treatment of repeated delimiters
	- starting row
	- specific columns
	- data format
	- variable names
- Tips:
	- import window remains open
	- save the code as a script for future use
	- use the `datetime` function to create a time series
	- [Example of final script](code/co2_load.m)
- Plot graph
	- line of best fit (tools > basic fitting) doesn't work with `datetime` format
	- plot doesn't update if data is modified

[data file]: data/co2_weekly_mlo.txt
[CO2]: https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/data.html
[temperature]: https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/dv/data/?parameter_name=Meteorology&site=MLO&category=Meteorology&frequency=Hourly%2BAverages
[metadata]: ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/data/meteorology/in-situ/README

---

## Process CO<sub>2</sub> data
- Remove bad data values using:
	- command line
	- [script]
	- function
- This is one way to build up functions
	1. test ideas in the command window
	2. save previously executed command(s) in a script
	3. rewrite the script as a function
	(i.e. generalise the code for greater flexibility)
		- Pass in variables
		- Pass out results
		- Comment your code (and ensure it works with `lookfor` and `help`)
- Demo using CO<sub>2</sub> data
- Final function: [badtonan.m]

[script]: code/co2_clean.m
[badtonan.m]: code/badtonan.m

## A method for writing functions

- Write pseudo-code to split your ideas into discrete tasks
- Start with a simplified task and progressively build up complexity
- Test ideas in the command window (or a script) first
- Split separate tasks into their own functions
	- Makes functions more reusable
	- Easier to write and debug
- Try to choose variable names which describe their meaning
	- Easier to understand
- Ensure the final product has comments describing the purpose of the function,
and an example of how to use it
	- This is a courtesy to your future self, as well as other users
- Pay attention to the coloured flags on the right edge of the editor window
	- Read the suggestions to improve the efficiency of your code

---
## Example functions (demo/exercise)
1. Load a folder of data files into MATLAB, creating one time series per variable
(rather than one per file)
2. Clean data (remove bad data points) and create (monthly) averages for
comparision with other data sets
3. Interrogate subsets of data to look at monthly / yearly variability
4. Calculate basic statistics
4. Automate the whole work flow using a function, making some sections optional
5. Check for overlap of data sets
5. Repeat for a different data set (global average surface temperature)
8. Import screenshot from paper, plot your data on top
	- clean up original image before adding your data

---
## 1. Load a directory of data files
## Pseudo-code
- loop through files in directory
- load data using separate function
	- generate function from import data tool
	- modify import data function to automatically generate variable names
- combine data from files into one array

---
## Order of tasks
- generate function to load a single data file using *import data* tool
	- start with a simplified task
	- refer to data/met_README for data format
- modify import data function to automatically generate variable names
	- use a structure
- loop through files in directory
	- initially just print file names to test loop works correctly
- load data by calling the separate *loader* function
- combine data from files into one array
- ensure the code is adequately commented

---
## Data structures
- Everything in MATLAB is a matrix
	- strings, scalar variables, vectors, matrices
- These can be grouped using data structures
	- Cell arrays for flexible data storage of multiple data types
```
>> myCell = {1,2,3,4;'example',rand(3,3,2),[3,2,1],{5,6,7}}
>> myCell{2,1}
ans =
example
```
	- Structures for named fields containing values
```
>> myStruct.name='My first structure';
>> myStruct.data=ones(10)
myStruct =
    name: 'My first structure'
    data: [10x10 double]
```
- Structure field names can be dynamically assigned using strings
```
myStruct.('demo') = 'Like this!'
```

---
### Problems encountered (and solutions)
- Can't dynamically assign variable names in MATLAB
	- Modify function to output a structure
- Output argument overwrites variables in workspace
	- Pass in variable to function, modify, then pass it back out
- Can only pass in a variable which exists
	- Create empty variable before first function call

---
### 2. Pseudo code to process data
- Combine structure rows to get one array per field
	- get list of field names
	- loop over fields, combining data
- Remove bad data points using previously written function
- Average data over user-specified intervals for comparison with other data sets
	- create a `datetime` variable type from double type variables *year, month, day, hour*
	- find required averaging intervals
	- average data onto new time base, ignoring NaN values
- Plot averaged data against CO2 data

## Debugging

---

## Approaches
- Know what outcome you are expecting
- Evaluate small sections of code at a time (one function, one line, one command)
- Using intermediate variables in loops can sometimes help debugging
- Explain the problem to someone else:
	- Write down what you're trying to do
	- What are the steps to reproduce the problem?
	- Very often the process of explaining the problem leads you to the error

---

## Tips and common problems
- Load data window remains open after loading data (looks like nothing has happened if maximised)
- Close MATLAB - no prompt to save workspace variables; only modified scripts
- Variables are implicitly declared so easy to accidentally overwrite

---
## Efficiency
- mlint checks for syntax errors and gives tips to improve functions and scripts
- preallocate arrays wherever possible
- use vector operations instead of loops (when possible) 
- use profiler to identify hotspots in code
